# Relational Database Project

## Narrative Description of the Business and Problem Being Addressed

The proposed project involves creating a database management system for a car rental business that currently relies on manual processes. This manual system leads to issues such as:  
- Difficulty in tracking vehicle availability  
- Errors in billing information  
- Challenges with managing customer reservations  
- Inefficiencies in handling rental agreements  

The business rents various types of vehicles, including sedans, SUVs, vans, and trucks, to customers on both short-term and long-term bases. A digital database management system would address these issues by:  
- Efficiently managing inventory  
- Reducing errors and incidents of double bookings  
- Simplifying operations for reservations, vehicle availability, billing, and record tracking  

By transitioning to a digital car rental database, the business aims to reduce errors, improve operational effectiveness, and enhance customer satisfaction.
